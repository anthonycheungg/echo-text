## Inspiration
We wanted to help those who were faced with financial difficulties to have a chance at using a basic search engine without paying the price of data

## What it does
Echo Text is a utility bot that searches and queries things you might need, without internet. All you need to do is text Echo Text with what you want, and it will respond.

## Challenges we ran into
As with any project, We were faced with many challenges. From working as a team, we were able to overcome our problems by keeping calm under stress while numerous debugging sessions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The program itself. We are proud that our bot has a real use after the numerous hours we put into it. Code-wise, the modular nature of our bot makes it easy to add new functionality within minutes.

## What we learned
A modular project allows for easier coding distribution among members. We also learned about the format and structure of more advanced python programs.

## What's next for Echo Text
We would like to try and add more functionality in the bot itself, including offline Google searching, web browsing, and Slack-ing. In the future, we could create an Android app wrapper that includes a GUI. This would make it more accessible and user-friendly.
